// Function Pointer as Return Type & Conclusion
/*
* A function pointer in C++ can also be used as a return type for a different function. 
  This means that the particular function will be returning a function pointer as the return type.

* But, the C++ compiler doesnâ€™t allow the return type for a function to be a function pointer in C++, so we will define the function pointer as a custom data type. After this, we can use this newly defined type, which is actually for a function pointer, as the return type for functions.

/* *** Conclusion ***
- Just like variables, functions also have pointers to them, that stores the address which points to the first instruction of the function.

- The address of a function can be accessed by just writing the function name without the ampersand (&).

- They are mainly useful for event-driven applications, callbacks, and even for storing the functions in arrays.

- Callback functions are functions that are executed when a particular event takes place. This can be achieved by using a function pointer.

- A function pointer cannot be used to allocate or deallocate memory as they point to the address of the code.

- We can also call a function indirectly with the help of a pointer (function pointer) by using the name of the function pointer.

- A function pointer can also be used as a return type or as an argument to another function.
