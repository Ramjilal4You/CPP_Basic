/**** Advantages & Disadvantages of Pointers ****/
/*
*** Advantages of Pointers ***
1. Pass Arguments by address(pointer)
2. Accessing Array Elements
3. Return Multiple Values from Function
4. Dynamic Memory Allocation
5. Implementing Data Structures
6. In System-Level Programming where memory addresses are useful.
7. In locating the exact value at some memory location.
8. To avoid compiler confusion for the same variable name.
*/

/*
*** Disadvantages of Pointers ***
1. Memory corruption can occur if an incorrect value is provided to pointers.
2. Uninitialized pointers might cause a segmentation fault.
3. Pointers are majorly responsible forÂ memory leaks.
4. Pointers are comparatively slower than variables.
5. Pointers are a little bit complex to understand.
